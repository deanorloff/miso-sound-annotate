# Annotation guide 

## Labeling relevant sounds

-   Label the onset and offset of each sound in Audacity with a
sufficiently detailed descriptive label, exporting the
annotations as a text file that is named identically to the
audio file name.

-   The descriptive label may not match the search terms exactly and
may vary in level of detail (e.g. "woman sniffling" could be
provided in user metadata but if not, it may not be possible to
determine a more detailed label than "sniffling"). For each new
descriptor, add it to the taxonomy file containing descriptive
labels and umbrella categories.

-  50 ms precision for onset & offset of sounds
